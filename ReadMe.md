Day 1:
- short day (30 min)
- eda.ipynb notebook
- graphed each column's distribution
- graphing pointplot of each columns values Vs. flood prediction prob.

Day 2:
- tried doing multi LR
- messed up for a while, thinking that train R^2 was near-perfect, but cross-val was 0.84 (both were 0.84)
- found that multi LR is equivalent to single LR on the mean of all X-values
- tried doing k-means, pca, t-sne, to make use of things other than just the mean of Xs (did not find patterns)
